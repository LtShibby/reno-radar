2. Click **"New Project"** â†’ **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Connect your GitHub account and select `reno-radar` repo
4. Railway will detect multiple services - **choose the `backend` folder**

### **B. Configure Railway Project**

2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Environment**
3. Add these environment variables:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=3001
   ```
4. Optional debugging variables (don't use in production):
   ```
   DEBUG_SCREENSHOTS=false
   DEBUG_HEADLESS=true
   ```

### **C. Deploy**
1. Railway will automatically deploy from your `backend/railway.toml` config
2. Wait for deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)
3. Copy your Railway app URL (something like `https://your-app-name.railway.app`)

## **Step 2: Update Frontend for Production**

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://your-railway-app-name.railway.app
   ```
4. **Important**: Replace with your actual Railway URL from Step 1C

### **B. Redeploy Frontend**

2. Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
3. Or push any change to GitHub to trigger auto-deployment

## **Step 3: Test Full Application**

### **A. Test Backend Health**
Visit: `https://your-railway-app-name.railway.app/health`

Should return:
```json
{"status":"OK","timestamp":"2024-01-20T..."}
```

### **B. Test Scraping API**
Visit: `https://your-railway-app-name.railway.app/api/scrape?query=renovation`

Should return JSON with comments array.

### **C. Test Frontend**
1. Visit your Vercel URL
2. Enter a search query (e.g., "kitchen renovation")
3. Verify it connects to Railway backend and displays results

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Railway Issues:**
- **Build fails**: Check `backend/package.json` has all dependencies
- **App crashes**: Check Railway logs in dashboard
- **Timeout errors**: Puppeteer needs time - normal for first requests

### **CORS Issues:**
- Verify Vercel URL is allowed in `backend/server.js` corsOptions
- Check Railway logs for CORS errors

### **Environment Variables:**
- Railway: Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- Vercel: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://your-railway-url`
